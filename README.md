Welcome to the Stock Market Portfolio Builder!

This app is designed to function with a prefiltered stock market database! In there you have labeled stocks, that are categorized in so called tiers (from SSS to D). 
These can be added to a starting page, where you can check out their performance, their price chart and you can even compare them to their underlying industry/sector/country. The comparison to their respective market is especially interesting to see if a stock under- or outperforms the market.

You can have multiple of these starting pages at the same time. They are structured as so called watchlists. You can add or remove stocks to your watchlists and save them to your preference!

For more infos feel free to read the Wiki pages. There I include all important topics that I can think of.
